/*
! Why do we use Classes?
? Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - Introduced in ES5
        - new way to write JS previous existing prototype-based inheritance.
        - A way of creating an object (acts like a blueprint) to create other objects.
    - Classes are the closest thing in vanilla JS to OOP.
? Blueprint
    - creating objects that share methods and properties.
    - used to create new objects or instances of that class.  
        - each object can have different values for properties they hold.
? Body of a Class
    - denoted between { } 
        - just like regular functions
    - where methods and/or constructor is defined.
    *Constructor
        - special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class.
        - can only be ONE method with the name of constructor in a class.
        - can use the keyword "super" to access and call functions (or methods) on an objects parent.
    - Can be written using two different syntaxes: 
        - Declarations
        - Expressions
        ! class declarations are NOT hoisted. (function declarations are hoisted)
